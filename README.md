# README.MD

Here is a a small Front-end project where I've used a public API using the data dynamically for one part and statically for the other part (using JSON file).

## Content
• In the "inicio" page there is a football stadium background.
• In "Partidos" page there is a input where you can find your team target (Spanish League), and filter by won/lost/draw matches.
• In "clasificacion" page you have the table of the "liga" updated in real time (Season 2021).
• In "Estadisticas" you have a table for the Top 5 Goal average per match.

## Live Demo
